### Laboratory Experiment No. 3
 
### Objective  
To interface a Seven Segment Display to the AT89S52 microcontroller
 
### Tools used  
- Software: 
  - MCU 8051 IDE 

### Experiment Outcome
- To learn about Seven Segment Displays
- To understand difference between Common Cathode & Common Anode displays
- To use Assembly instructions to toggle individual LEDs of the display
- To generate numerical numbers 0-9 & display them on the display
- To generate delay by means of the Rx registers
- To use loops & jumps to perform the delay operations

### Instructions

1. Read about Seven Segment Display Interfacing (Kenneth Ayala/ Mazidi)
2. Use the Atmel 8051 Instruction sheet document to learn about the arithmetic instructions
